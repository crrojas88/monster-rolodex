# Monster Rolodex

Welcome to Monster Rolodex! A very bare bones React app that filters monsters based on what you type in the search bar.
<br/>
Check out the app [here](https://crrojas88.github.io/monster-rolodex/)

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple React JS app that showcases the versatility of React and the React library with some basic concepts.


## Functionality

This app highlights some basic React concepts like:

- Component architecture
- Use and placement of state
- Unidirectional data flow
- Props
- Destructuring
- Functional and presentational components
- Class methods and arrow functions
- Fetching and mounting
